## Introduction

API integration is a crucial element of modern enterprise architectures, enabling systems to communicate and share data effectively. This document outlines key patterns for API integration, focusing on best practices that ensure scalability, reusability, and maintainability.

## Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP)

Enterprise Integration Patterns provide guidelines for integrating disparate systems in a consistent and scalable manner. MuleSoft supports a variety of these patterns, and they should be considered when designing integrations.

- **Key Practice**: Keep integrations **stateless** to enhance scalability and reduce costs.
- **Avoid**: Implementing **business logic** in the integration layer, which could complicate future extensibility.

## API-Led Methodology

API-led connectivity organizes APIs into a layered approach to simplify development and enable reuse. This methodology connects data through reusable APIs that fulfill distinct roles.

### Layers:
1. **System APIs**: Expose core systems of record (e.g., CRM, databases).
2. **Process APIs**: Encapsulate business processes and shape data.
3. **Experience APIs**: Serve data across multiple channels, providing data in the required format for various consumers.

### Benefits of API-Led Connectivity:
- **Business Benefits**:
  - IT can act as a platform for business innovation by exposing data as APIs.
  - Increases productivity by promoting API reuse.
  - Modularized architecture leads to more predictable change and better delivery timelines.
  
- **Technical Benefits**:
  - Distributed architecture supports loose coupling and flexible governance.
  - Greater agility due to separation of responsibilities at different layers.

- **Operational Benefits**:
  - Holistic connectivity offers end-to-end visibility for tracking API requests and responses.

## API Patterns

### Synchronous Real-Time
- **When to Use**: When the API consumer needs immediate access to data and expects a real-time response.
- **Benefits**: Simple and scalable. RESTful APIs require minimal infrastructure and are easy to monitor.
- **Responsibility**: The API consumer handles retry logic and message loss in case of failures.

**Example Use Case**: Immediate data retrieval for customer requests in a CRM system.

### Asynchronous Near-Real Time
- **When to Use**: When the consumer needs data but can tolerate some delay.
- **Benefits**: Non-blocking operation improves speed and reduces consumer-side complexity.
- **Required Technology**: Message queues like AnypointMQ, RabbitMQ, or AWS SQS.

**Example Use Case**: Systems that require periodic updates but do not require immediate confirmation.

### Event-Driven Asynchronous Near-Real Time

- **When to Use**:
  - If the source system can publish events, the API triggers message delivery to multiple systems in near real-time.
  - If the source system cannot publish events, REST APIs are used to publish events to a topic.

- **Benefits**: Highly resilient and extensible with built-in reliability.
- **Technology**: Requires message brokers for event distribution.

**Example Use Case**: Systems where multiple downstream processes depend on an event trigger from a single source, such as inventory updates.

## Data Integrations

### Batch Processing
- **When to Use**: In scenarios involving large data migrations where real-time processing is not feasible.
- **Benefits**: Efficient resource utilization through multithreaded batch programs. Ideal for large, frequent delta loads.
  
**Example Use Case**: Migrating large datasets between legacy systems and cloud environments.

### Streaming
- **When to Use**: For ongoing data synchronization or real-time data streams where updates are frequent.
- **Benefits**: Provides efficient, low-latency data updates for scenarios like real-time analytics.

## File Integrations

- For large files or data transfers, MuleSoft supports batch processing and streaming to ensure efficient handling.
