## Introduction

This document outlines best practices for naming conventions, configuration management, logging, monitoring, and other crucial aspects of application development. These guidelines ensure consistency, scalability, and security across projects.

## Naming Conventions

### Overview

Following consistent naming conventions improves code readability and maintainability across teams.

### Naming Convention Examples

- **Lower Camel Case**: Use for variables and attributes (e.g., `firstName`, `indexNumber`, `accountsId`).
- **Upper Camel Case**: Use for data types (e.g., `Account`, `Index`, `Name`).
- **Upper Snake Case**: Use for configuration components (e.g., `Salesforce_Config`, `Http_Listener_Config`).
- **Screaming Snake Case**: Use for constants (e.g., `INTEREST_RATE`, `CONSTANT_NUMBER`).
- **Kebab Case**: Use for XML files, flow names (e.g., `employee-api`, `global-subflow`).
- **Lower Dot Case**: Use for DataWeave resource packages and Maven Group IDs (e.g., `dw.employees`, `com.customer`).

### Mule Application Naming

- **Mule Projects**: Use **Kebab Case** (e.g., `company-customer-api`).
- **Maven Group IDs**: Use **Lower Dot Case** (e.g., `com.customer`).
- **Mule XML Files**: Use **Kebab Case** (e.g., `crud-accounts.xml`).
- **Mule Configuration Files**: Use **Lower Kebab Case** (e.g., `http-listener-config`).
- **Mule Properties Files**: Use **Kebab Case** (e.g., `employees-dev.properties`).

## Externalize Configurations

### General Guidelines
- **Externalize configurations** for values that may change between environments (e.g., hostnames, credentials, ports).
- Avoid **hard-coding** environment-specific values to facilitate easy deployment across environments without redeploying artifacts.
- Use **property files** for different environments, including both plain-text and encrypted values.

### Secure Configuration Properties
- **Encrypt sensitive credentials** using the Mule Secure Configuration Properties feature.
- Store encrypted properties separately, and use the `secure::` prefix to access encrypted values.

Example:
```properties
secure::db.password=!encryptedValueHere
```

For more details, refer to the [MuleSoft Secure Configuration Properties documentation](https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/latest/secure-configuration-properties).

## Operational Logging

### Logging in Mule

- Mule uses **Log4j2** for logging, and the **Logger** component can be used to create log messages within flows.
- The default log level is **INFO**. Log levels such as DEBUG and TRACE can be configured when needed.
- Logs can be directed to various appenders such as system console, files, or the CloudHub logging service.

### Log Configuration
- Mule runtimes use **asynchronous logging** by default.
- CloudHub logs are managed using **Runtime Manager**, which allows overriding log levels and categories without redeploying applications.

## API Functional Monitoring

### Monitoring Configuration
- **API Functional Monitoring** is part of Anypoint Monitoring and provides the ability to monitor API endpoints.
- Configure health-check endpoints for your Mule applications, similar to **Kubernetes-style probes**:
  - **Liveness Probes**: Check if the application is deployed and responding.
  - **Readiness Probes**: Check if dependencies are ready to process requests.

Example:
```properties
anypoint.platform.config.analytics.agent.enabled=true
anypoint.platform.visualizer.layer=Process
```

## Anypoint Visualizer

- Anypoint Visualizer provides real-time graphical representation of Mule applications across the API-Led Connectivity layers.
- Ensure proper permissions are assigned to use the visualizer:
  - **View Applications**: Requires Runtime Manager read permission.
  - **Visualizer Editor**: Requires Visualizer Editor permission.

## Extract Common Flows into Libraries

- **Reuse common flows and configurations** across multiple projects to reduce redundancy.
- Common components include:
  - Flows and sub-flows
  - Error handlers
  - Global configurations
  - DataWeave scripts

To achieve this, create a **shared Mule project** and add it as a Maven dependency in other projects.
