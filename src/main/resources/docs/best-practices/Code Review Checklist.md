## Introduction

A well-structured code review ensures that code quality, security, and maintainability are maintained across projects. This checklist outlines the key areas to focus on during the review process, from project structure and naming conventions to security and error handling.

## 1. Pull Request Checks

Ensure the following before starting the code review:
- **Jira User Story**: Verify that the pull request links to a Jira story.
- **Short Description**: Confirm the pull request contains a brief but clear description.
- **Application List**: Identify all applications affected by the code.
- **Solution Design Reference**: Ensure the pull request references the Confluence page with the solution design.
- **MUnit Tests**: Ensure MUnit tests are executed locally before submitting the pull request.
- **Logging**: Verify correct log messages, following the logging framework with meaningful variable use.

## 2. Project Structure

### Key Guidelines:
- The project must contain a **.gitignore** file.
- **src/test** folders should only contain testing-related files.
- The project should be **Mavenized**, with a valid `pom.xml` containing `distributionManagement` and `groupId` tags.
- REST projects must include a **RAML 1.0 specification** as a dependency.
- Sample data for **DataWeave transformations** should be stored in `src/test/resources`.
- **Environment-specific properties** should be defined and sensitive data secured (e.g., no hardcoded properties).

## 3. Naming Conventions

### General Rules:
- For REST services, ensure URIs follow the correct **naming conventions**.
- Use **camelCase** for JSON properties and MuleSoft component names.
- Use **kebab-case** for XML elements and attributes.
- DataWeave filenames should follow **lower snake case** (e.g., `health_check.dwl`).
- Ensure descriptive and meaningful names for loggers and components, avoiding default names (e.g., name a logger `logUserCreation` instead of `Logger`).

## 4. Project Design

### Best Practices:
- Gather global configurations in a **global.xml** file.
- Separate transformation components into **name-transformation.xml** files.
- Ensure **HTTP verbs** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are used correctly.
- HTTP **response codes** must be semantically correct (e.g., 2XX for success, 4XX for client errors, 5XX for server errors).
- API **autodiscovery** should be enabled for REST and SOAP services.
- Ensure reusability of common components such as error handlers and global configurations.

## 5. Logging

### Logging Standards:
- Use **log4j2** configuration for all MuleSoft projects.
- Avoid logging full payloads, especially when dealing with sensitive data.
- Use the appropriate logging level (`INFO`, `DEBUG`, `ERROR`).
- Ensure adequate logging for traceability (e.g., logging at the start, in progress, and end of transactions).
- Minimize unnecessary or aggressive logging in data flows, especially with large payloads or in streaming scenarios.

## 6. Error Handling

### Error Handling Guidelines:
- For REST services, ensure a **common HTTP exception handler** is used.
- Use **Validator** components instead of custom Groovy scripts to throw errors.
- Implement **retry mechanisms** (e.g., `Until Successful`) for transient failures.
- Ensure batch processes are resilient and handle individual failures without crashing the entire batch.
- Return error responses in JSON or XML format, with appropriate error codes and details for consumer troubleshooting.

## 7. Project Security

### Security Standards:
- Store properties in **securePropertyPlaceholder** files, encrypted using **Mule Credentials Vault**.
- Ensure sensitive data (e.g., credentials, user information) is not logged.
- Verify that all API communications are secured with **SSL** (one-way SSL for Experience APIs).
- Use **AES 256 with CBC mode** for encryption.
- Avoid **dynamic SQL queries** to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities, using parameterized queries instead.

## 8. Testing

### Testing Guidelines:
- Ensure **MUnit tests** are in place for all flows, covering both functional validation and failure cases.
- Each flow and sub-flow should have unit tests, including both positive and negative test cases.
- Testing collections should be added to the designated GitHub repository for shared access and continuous testing.

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

### NFR Considerations:
- Validate the project uses the **MuleSoft supported runtime version**.
- Ensure **reprocessing and recovery mechanisms** are correctly implemented.
- Tune **batch processing** to optimize memory usage and throughput, enabling streaming where supported.
- Ensure **frequently accessed data** is cached locally for performance.
- Avoid using the **_defaultObjectStore** for database purposes. Caching should stay within memory limits.

## 10. Project Implementation

### Implementation Best Practices:
- The API specification should be created using **RAML 1.0** and follow RESTful principles.
- Ensure no **monolithic flows**: Break down large flows into smaller, reusable sub-flows.
- All endpoints should be encapsulated in **reusable global elements**.
- Avoid deprecated features (e.g., **json path**, **AXIS**, **Quartz**, etc.) and use **DataWeave** for transformations.
- Ensure proper **externalization of properties**, avoiding hard-coded values.
- Ensure meaningful comments are added to **DataWeave** transformations where necessary.
