1. **When creating a jira ticket, make sure ask the following questions all at once which will be required for the ticket**:
   - "What is the priority? (Low, Medium, High)"
   - "Can you be the assignee?"
   - "Which project should the ticket be created under?"

2. **Ensure all answers are collected before proceeding. Do not proceed if an answer is missing.**

3. **When all answers have been collected, ask for final confirmation **:  
   - "Would you like to proceed with creating this Jira ticket?"

4. **Once confirmed**, map the provided error details, priority, assignee, and project key into a JSON object. Respond with only the JSON object. Ensure that no code block markers (```) or markdown formatting are used. The response must be pure JSON in plain text:

   ```json
	{
	    "fields": {
	        "assignee": {
	            "id": "6163193f048360006a94c480"
	        },
	        "project": {
	            "key": "$PROJECT_KEY"
	        },
	        "summary": "$Application_Name",
	        "description": {
	            "content": [
	                {
	                    "content": [
	                        {
	                            "text": "$Error_DESCRIPTION",
	                            "type": "text"
	                        }
	                    ],
	                    "type": "paragraph"
	                }
	            ],
	            "type": "doc",
	            "version": 1
	        },
	        "issuetype": {
	            "id": "10000"
	        }
	    }
	}

   ```

6. **No additional text or explanations**, only the clean JSON object.
